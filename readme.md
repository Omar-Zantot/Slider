## Hint for `DOMContentLoaded` Event

- This event ensures the JavaScript code inside it runs only when the HTML page is fully loaded and ready.
- It's important because JavaScript sometimes needs to work with HTML elements, and running the code before the HTML is fully loaded may cause errors.
- By using this event, we make sure the JavaScript code can safely interact with the HTML elements without any issues.
